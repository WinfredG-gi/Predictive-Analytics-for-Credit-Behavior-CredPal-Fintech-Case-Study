# Predictive-Analytics-for-Credit-Behavior-CredPal-Fintech-Case-Study
Team-based fintech analytics project usingTableau to evaluate CredPal’s consumer spending and saving patterns. We applied predictive insights to assess credit scalability and guide Stripe’s investment decisions through data-driven recommendations.
This team-based project explored **CredPal’s consumer credit and spending patterns** using advanced data visualization and predictive analytics tools — **Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio**.  
Our objective was to derive actionable insights that could guide **Stripe’s investment decisions** and assess the **scalability of CredPal’s credit model** across consumer segments.

## 🏦 Background  

**CredPal** is a Nigerian fintech startup providing point-of-sale credit infrastructure that enables consumers to access on-demand financing while helping merchants boost sales.  
Despite its success (driving up to **200% sales growth** in small businesses), the question remains — **can CredPal’s credit solution scale further and sustain profitability?**

To answer this, Stripe’s investment team commissioned an internal study to analyze:  
- Consumer spending habits across income levels and regions.  
- Credit repayment behavior and saving capabilities.  
- Predictive indicators of creditworthiness and purchasing power.  

Our team of 10 analysts was tasked with deriving intelligence to validate or challenge these assumptions.

## 🧩 Problem Statement  

While Stripe aimed to confirm that spending patterns align with saving capability, our analytical stance was more investigative:  
> *Does spending behavior alone accurately predict a consumer’s credit reliability and scalability potential?*

We examined CredPal’s data to:  
1. Evaluate the relationship between **spending habits** and **saving potential**.  
2. Identify **consumer segments** most likely to sustain credit.  
3. Uncover **regional differences** in credit uptake and repayment.  
4. Recommend **data-driven strategies** for scaling CredPal’s model.  


## Tools & Techniques  

We leveraged three key Business Intelligence tools to ensure multi-platform analytical depth:  

- **Power BI:** Data modeling, segmentation, DAX measures, and predictive visuals.  
- **Tableau:** Advanced storytelling dashboards and regional trend visualization.  
 

## Analytical Approach  

1. **Data Understanding & Preparation:**  
   - Explored consumer transactions, regional patterns, and income distributions.  
   - Validated data completeness and consistency across fields.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
   - Assessed spending vs saving correlations by demographic and region.  
   - Detected outliers and high-risk consumer behaviors.  

3. **Predictive Modeling & Segmentation:**  
   - Built credit behavior indicators using spending ratios and saving tendencies.  
   - Created dynamic visuals to predict likely credit adoption and repayment strength.  

4. **Business Insight Generation:**  
   - Compared merchant growth across business sizes (small, medium, large).  
   - Quantified scalability potential by consumer region and category.  
   - Evaluated whether the reported **23% average retail growth** could increase through smarter credit allocation.  



## Key Insights  

- **Strongest Markets:**  
  - **Sub-Saharan Africa ($34.7M)** and **Europe ($34.3M)** recorded the highest average incomes and spending levels, making them CredPal’s most scalable regions.  
  - These markets also displayed **solid saving rates** (~26%), indicating high repayment capacity and consumer financial discipline.  

- **Spending Behavior:**  
  - Higher-income regions showed proportionally high expenditures, supporting CredPal’s **on-demand credit model**.  
  - **Essential goods (Office Supplies, Household Products)** dominated spending, highlighting stable, necessity-driven purchasing patterns.  

- **Consumer Preference:**  
  - **Clothes, Cosmetics, and Personal Care** products had the highest preference counts, signaling active retail engagement and strong market responsiveness.  

- **Financial Relationships:**  
  - Positive correlation between **income and expenditure**, but savings rates varied across regions, proving that not all high spenders are high savers.  
  - Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe balanced spending with strong savings, while North America lagged with low disposable income and a 2.17% savings rate.

## Recommendations  

1. **Prioritize Market Expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe**  
   - Focus investment here due to high income, expenditure, and savings levels — strong indicators of repayment reliability.  

2. **Tailor Credit Products to Necessity-Driven Categories**  
   - Prioritize credit options for **Office Supplies, Household Products, and Meat**, as these are essential and recurring expenses.  

3. **Segment Credit Strategies by Financial Behavior**  
   - *Sub-Saharan Africa & Europe:* Offer flexible credit lines and loyalty incentives.  
   - *Asia & MENA:* Moderate limits with financial literacy campaigns.  
   - *North America & Australia:* Use alternative models (e.g., BNPL with stricter repayment terms).  

4. **Leverage Consumer Preference Data for Targeted Marketing**  
   - Develop region-specific credit bundles for high-demand categories like **Personal Care and Cosmetics**.  

5. **Use Predictive Analytics to Strengthen Credit Risk Models**  
   - Integrate regional **income-expenditure-savings** correlations into credit scoring to reduce default rates.  

6. **Build Data Partnerships for Continuous Insights**  
   - Collaborate with merchants and financial institutions in high-performing regions to collect **real-time consumer intelligence** for dynamic credit adjustments.
